# Machine-Learning-Projects
I decided to group my projects depending on what I am currently learning. Right now, I am learning Machine, and this folder holds out the projects I'll be creating
When I started out, my first project was the Titanic Survival Prediction and I didn't really understand a lot about the models.
I learnt about classification and regression
Currently, I am comfortable to realize a problem and build a model across it. 
I advice to start with something like the Cupcake and Muffin, datasets that are simple and easier to understand, as you work your way up to Loan Predictions and all.
